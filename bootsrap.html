                    <p>There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 5 on your own web site.</p>
                <p>You can:

                  Include Bootstrap 5 from a CDN
                  Download Bootstrap 5 from getbootstrap.com

                    <p>If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>
                <p>jsDelivr provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript:

                  <summary>Why Bootsrap CDN</summary>
                    <p>Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 5 from jsDelivr when visiting another site.</p>
                <p> As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>

                        <p>You can:
                          Include Bootstrap 5 from a CDN

                            <p>If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>
                        <p>jsDelivr provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript:

                            <p>Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 5 from jsDelivr when visiting another site.</p>
                        <p> As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
